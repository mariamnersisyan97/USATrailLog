## Trails is the join table for users and states

## Each user has a trail 
## Each trail has a state 

# On user login, the user can add a trail to the DB and also view the list of their personal trails 
# The user can also filter their trails by state 


# Add to state list once logged in
# Add to trail list once logged in

# States should show trails /states/trails/${id}
